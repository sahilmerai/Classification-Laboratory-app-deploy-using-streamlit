# Classification Laboratory 📉

The Classification Laboratory is a dynamic model that accepts csv data from users for classification issues with a binary outcome as the dependent variable.

This laboratory assists users in gaining insight into data, and users will receive an EDA report📑 based on pandas profiling of the file they provide.

A classifier manager aids in the management of various machine learning algorithms and the selection of the most appropriate parameters for all models.Deploy a classification laboratory using streamlit
